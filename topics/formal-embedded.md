title: Formal Methods for Embedded Systems
---

Formal methods can be key technology to ensure the reliable, correct and safe
execution of embedded systems with their ever increasing complexity.

With our strong background both in formal verification and embedded system
design, the AEMY team currently works on various topics, mostly around:

- Formal verification of embedded virtualization technologies
- Easier access to formal verification of standard libraries for embedded
  systems and their startup code
- New methods for formal verification of embedded floating point software
