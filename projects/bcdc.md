Our team is part of the [Bavarian Chip Design Center (BCDC)](). The goal of the
BCDC is to support local small and medium sized enterprises with accessing chip
design. The project is lead by three Fraunhofer institutes, and a few leading
Bavarian universities support the ambition with their research and technology
transfer capabilities.

We have two projects in the BCDC:

- RISC-V Instruction Set Extensions for domain-specific platforms, focusing on
  DSP and cryptographic applications
- Generators for hybrid on-chip and off-chip interconnects for
  application-specific workloads and QoS guarantees
