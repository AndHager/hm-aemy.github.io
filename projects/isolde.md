ISOLDE Project will have high performance RISC-V processing systems and
platforms at least at TRL 7 for the vast majority of building blocks,
demonstrated for key European application domains such as automotive, space and
IoT with the expectation that two years after completion ISOLDE's high
performance components will be used in industrial quality products.

The AEMY team works on two major topics inside the ISOLDE project:

 - Processor support to accelerate Bytecode Virtualization (WebAssembly)
 - Fault-injection support with the Verilator simulation tool and frameworks
   targeted at Hardware/Software-Codesign of mitigations
