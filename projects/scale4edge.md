title: Scale4Edge
---

Scale4Edge is a joint project funded by the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education
and Research), which aims to significantly reduce the currently relatively long
development times and high development costs of application-specific edge
components (platform concept). The approach pursued in the project is based on
providing a commercial ecosystem for a scalable and flexibly expandable edge
computing platform after the end of the project. The ecosystem will be created
by a large number of SMEs in cooperation with industry and research institutes.
Each SME contributes its expertise and markets the result as part of its own
product portfolio after the end of the project.

In this project the AEMY team focuses on methodologies and tools to guide the design of instruction set extensions for RISC-V based computing platforms utilizing variable length instruction codings.
