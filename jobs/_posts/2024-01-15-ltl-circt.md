---

For our research projects we are looking for a qualified and motivated new team
member. This position focuses on the interoperability of open source chip design
tools. Such Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are required to design and
validate semiconductor chips and there is an increasing ecosystem of open source
tools. To improve the support and adoption of dynamic verification and formal
verification using "linear temporal logic (LTL)", novel methods and extensions
to the CIRCT chip design compiler framework (based on LLVM) are explored. The
goal is support for LTL throughout the open source chip design tools Verilator,
Yosys and CIRCT. You will be closely working together with these project
communities.

Your profile should cover:

- Enthusiasm for open source development and collaboration
- Basic understanding of compilers and tooling
- Basic understanding of digital design
- Ideally: Understanding of verification

Join us now:

- to become a member of a great team in Munich, Germany
- to work closely with an international open source community
- to pursue a PhD degree at a small and focused research group
- to be actively involved with relevant industry partners in the area
