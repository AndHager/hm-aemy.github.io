For our research projects we are looking for a qualified and motivated new team
member. This position involves the design of highly optimized RISC-V instruction
set extensions. RISC-V is an open instruction set, that has been in the center
of innovative computer architecture research. The goal is to explore extensions
to RISC-V for highly-optimized embedded systems with minimized memory footprint.

Your profile should cover:

- Understanding of Hardware-/Software-Interfaces
- Fundamental understanding of compilers and tooling
- Not a must: Knowledge of hardware design
- Ideally some experience with RISC-V


Join us now:

- to become a member of a great team in Munich, Germany
- to be in the epicenter of RISC-V and open source chip design
- to pursue a PhD degree at a small and focused research group
- to be actively involved with relevant industry partners in the area
