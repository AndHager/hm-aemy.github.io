For our research projects we are looking for a qualified and motivated new team
member. This position focuses on the evaluation and design of methods and tools
for the design of optimized on-chip and off-chip interconnect of complex
chiplet-based heterogeneous chip designs. You will be building on existing open
source designs and tools flows and explore their extension to an open source
hardware/software-codesign tool flow for novel architectures.

Your profile should cover:

- Fundamental understanding of computer architecture
- Basic understanding of digital chip design
- Ideally some experience with interconnect design

Join us now:

- to become a member of a great team in Munich, Germany
- to be in the epicenter of RISC-V and open source chip design
- to pursue a PhD degree at a small and focused research group
- to be actively involved with relevant industry partners in the area
