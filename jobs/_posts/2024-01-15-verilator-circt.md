For our research projects we are looking for a qualified and motivated new team
member. This position focuses on the interoperability of open source chip design
tools. Such Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are required to design and
validate semiconductor chips and there is an increasing ecosystem of open source
tools. To increase the interoperability of those tools, novel methods and
interfaces for three of the main digital design tools Verilator, Yosys and CIRCT
are to be investigated and developed. You will be closely working together with
these project communities.

Your profile should cover:

- Enthusiasm for open source development and collaboration
- Basic understanding of compilers and tooling
- Ideally: basic understanding of digital design

Join us now:

- to become a member of a great team in Munich, Germany
- to work closely with an international open source community
- to pursue a PhD degree at a small and focused research group
- to be actively involved with relevant industry partners in the area
