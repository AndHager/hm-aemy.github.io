We are the research group for *sAfe sEcure and sMart sYstems (AEMY)* at
Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences. We are actively involved in
research projects and education around the most important and innovative topics
from deeply embedded systems to large scale computer systems.

### Research Topics

Our current research focus covers the following areas:

- innovative solutions for safe, secure and smart chip designs based on the open
  RISC-V instruction set architecture and its ecosystem (learn more)
- open source chip design tools as an enablement for a resilient sovereign chip
  design ecosystem and future innovative tools (learn more)
- bytecode virtualization with WebAssembly for embedded systems as a technology
  with excellent security properties (learn more)
- accessible formal verification of embedded systems that enables developers
  with the right toolset to quicker develop safe and secure embedded system
  software

### All Open Source!

Our research is mostly open source with very rare exceptions. We strongly
believe that our results and code should be available to everyone to extend and
build commercial solutions around.

### Want to Get Involved?

Please get in touch if you want to work with our group, are interested to
collaborate or look for a job!
